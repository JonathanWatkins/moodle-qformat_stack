Stack question importer
=======================

This is work in progress towards an importer that can import Stack 2.0 questions
into Moodle. It was created by Matti Pauna working with Chris Sangwin and Tim Hunt.

To get this code, run

    git clone git://github.com/maths/moodle-qformat_stack.git question/format/stack

in the top-level folder of your Moodle install.

For full install instructions, see the [STACK install instructions](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Installation/index.md).
